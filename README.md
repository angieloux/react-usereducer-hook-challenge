# React: useReducer Hook (Customizable message board)

This is a refactoring of a previous challenge I completed [here](https://github.com/angieloux/react-usereducer-hook-challenge). I have refactored the previous app (that used `useState`) to use the `useReducer` hook to garner an understanding of how it works. [This](https://youtu.be/i_M3xKgcskE) is what the app looks like.
